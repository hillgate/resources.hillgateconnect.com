        <h2 id="identify-your-needs">Identify Your Needs</h2>
        <p>It might seem obvious to start with identifying your needs, but most people never get to this point. Getting here requires reflection. You must acknowledge that something is wrong and decide to deal with it. Think of your workload as your work
          health. You are often aware of the symptoms, but not the root cause.</p>
        <p>The symptoms manifest themselves in things like the amount of time you’re spending at work, the quality of your output or and your stress level. Once you’ve accepted that there is a problem, you can move to figuring out how to fix it.</p>
        <p>Most problems break down into toe two categories:</p>
        <h3 id="1-skills-or-knowledge-gaps">1. Skills or Knowledge Gaps</h3>
        <p>There is a critical requirement(s) for your project and you don’t have this requirement available inhouse. A specific need makes it easy to create a clear, targeted project brief. However, it can be hard to find a unicorn. This can often involve
          a level of expertise provided by the candidate.</p>
        <h3 id="2-lack-of-bandwidth">2. Lack of Bandwidth</h3>
        <p>Simply put — you have too much work. By the nature of the need, this challenge can be harder to write a project brief for this need. Conversely, it can be easier to find the right candidate if you have broader needs. These two needs aren’t mutually
          exclusive, so you might need to solve for both. Regardless of how you classify your need(s), the key at this stage is to have a clear idea of what you need.</p>
        <h2 id="define-a-project-brief">Define a Project Brief</h2>
        <p>This is one of the most important points in the process. You will need to make sure that you’re clear about the specific workstreams, expectations and deliverables for this project to be a success.</p>
        <h3 id="workstreams">Workstreams</h3>
        <p>Most projects have multiple subcomponents. You should be able to break down these components into 3-5 main tasks. These are your titles. You then fill in 1-3 specific items under each of these. You can see an example here. The goal is to provide
          enough information to candidates so that they have a sense of the type and amount of work required for this work.</p>
        <h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
        <p>Next, you need to identify what you’re looking for at the end of the project. The deliverables can range from a financial model to a market research report depending on your needs. Again, the goal is to make sure that you’re on the same page
          as the candidate(s).</p>
        <h2 id="define-your-ideal-candidate">Define Your Ideal Candidate</h2>
        <p>The level of detail here depends on which need you’ve identified. If you’re looking for extra bandwidth, then you might have more leeway in your requirements. You are likely looking for a generalist with a core skill set such as market researching
          skills, excel or powerpoint skills.</p>
        <p>If you have a specific need, then your requirements should be clear. Should you find yourself struggling to identify the skills, then you can reverse engineer it. Start with your own (and your team’s) skill or knowledge gaps.</p>
        <h3 id="seniority">Seniority</h3>
        <p>The experience-level can depend on the type of work you need. If you want someone to do data analysis, then you likely want someone younger. If you’re looking for more nuanced input, then more experience might be preferable. Often, we see clients
          looking for someone with a blend of these two. That often means a skill set with 3-5 years experience post-MBA. This is often someone who holds the title Manager at a consulting firm or larger company. Feel free to reference our seniority
          guide here.</p>
        <h3 id="functional-experience">Functional Experience</h3>
        <p>This is usually one of the most important components to consider. If you’re doing a due diligence project, then you’ll want someone who has worked in Investment Banking/Corporate Development. If you need someone to do primary research, then
          you might not be too picky. Often, you can reference the deliverables in order to identify the appropriate functional skills.</p>
        <h3 id="industry-experience">Industry Experience</h3>
        <p>Depending on the work, this can be the most important criteria. It is important to consider how direct and granular you need the experience to be. Do you prefer someone who worked in an industry as an advisor (such as a banker or consultant)
          or directly in the industry? For granularity, do you want someone who worked in medical device or someone who worked for a hip-replacement device maker? Sometimes you will start out with your ideal (we call these unicorns) and decide that
          closely related experience also translates works well.</p>
        <h3 id="geographic-focus">Geographic Focus</h3>
        <p>This is pretty clear, but there can be a level of granularity that is related to where you are in the process. For example, let’s say you’re looking for an assessment of the Indian food-delivery market. At an early stage, you might just want
          someone who knows India broadly or a couple of the major cities. At a later stage, the nuances between north and south India become more important.</p>
        <h3 id="language-abilities">Language Abilities</h3>
        <p>This is pretty clear. You likely require someone to interact with local participants or do research where most of the work is done in a native language. Unless you think there’s a difference between English and American, this is probably the
          easiest of the choices!</p>
        <p>The goal in selecting your candidate is to find the best person who can help you achieve your goals. It is like dating- there’s rarely a perfect candidate. The goal is to find someone who complements your skills well and who you can work with.</p>
        <h2 id="prepare-the-specifics">Prepare the Specifics</h2>
        <p>This section is usually straightforward and incredibly important. Unfortunately, some of these details are often over-looked. That’s because it can be awkward to discuss some of the details, especially the budget. Transparency is the best approach
          here. When both parties share their position it leads to faster, more trusted negotiations. Examples of negotiation strategies can be found here.</p>
        <h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>
        <p>Your project budget should be combination of what you can spend and the fair-market value of the person you’re contracting. If you find budget to be a significant impediment, then focus on changing the scope of the project to fit within both
          party’s needs.</p>
        <h3 id="timing">Timing</h3>
        <p>When do you need the work completed? You will want to set a deadline for the project. At the beginning of your search process this can be a placeholder that is refined once you’ve engaged in the final scope/budget negotiations.
        </p>
        <h3 id="location-remote-vs-on-site">Location (Remote vs On Site)</h3>
        <p>It is important to think through where you want to work done. Many projects can be completed remotely, especially if you’re looking at a new geography or industry. This is even truer in the age of Skype and Dropbox. Sometimes, you need the person
          on-site. Often, you can work out a combination of both. In fact, there is usually very little reason to have someone on-site 100% of the time. Remote or hybrid working can save significant budget and time for everyone involved.</p>
        <h3 id="payment-terms">Payment Terms</h3>
        <p>Ideally, you should organize a payment schedule that benefits both parties. This usually involves the client paying a percentage (25-50%) up front and the remainder upon successful completion of the project. If the project is short-term (say
          less than two weeks), then you might adjust the terms so that the candidate is compensated at the end of the project. The goal here is find an agreement that both parties feel benefits them.</p>
        <h2 id="organize-the-paperwork">Organize the Paperwork</h2>
        <p>Congratulations, you’re almost there! Getting here means you’ve found the right person and agreed to the terms of working together. However, the paperwork stage is often where things grind to a halt. You might not have a template or previous
          example to work with. You might need to work with your internal stakeholders (Procurement, Legal, HR). This can really hold up the process, especially if you’re trying to contract with an individual. As soon as you know you will be looking
          to bring in an external resource, you should start working to ensure that you have these documents and processes in place. This will ensure a speedy start to your project.</p>
        <h3 id="terms-and-conditions-ndas-etc">Terms and Conditions (NDAs, etc)</h3>
        <p>This is usually the core document(s) that covers confidentiality, expectations and explains how various situations are dealt with. It will explain the broader relationship between two parties. You will want to make sure you have something in
          place prior to starting your project.</p>
        <h3 id="sign-the-project-contract">Sign the Project Contract</h3>
        <p>This should be specific to the project work. It should cover all the details we’ve covered in sections 1-4 and should be signed by both parties.</p>
        <h3 id="pay-the-contract">Pay the Contract</h3>
        <p>This process should be simple, but too often it isn’t. Internal bureaucracy, delayed response rates and/or cash flows can impact the timing of payment. Of course, you should try to pay according to the terms. However, when there is a problem
          you should communicate with your counter-party and inform them of what you’re doing (and, perhaps, what they can do) to expedite the situation. Managing the paperwork can be the most challenging part of the process.</p>
        <p>It can impact on the timing of your project and the happiness of your candidate. This is why it is so important to ensure that you have a plan to manage this component of the process.</p>
