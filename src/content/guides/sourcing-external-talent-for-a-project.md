This goal of this guide is to help you plan, source and work with external talent. Many of these suggestions will help you source internal candidates as well. This guide is based on our experience running Hillgate and working on both sides of the client-consultant relationship over the years.

#	Identify and communicate the need

You have been given (or decided on) your strategic priorities. You know that there are gaps in your team’s skills, experience or availability. The key is to determine what the gap is. You can divide these into two categories:

##	A specific need or a lack of bandwidth

A specific needs means that there is a critical requirement for your 	project and you don’t have the right skills or experience on the team. You 	may also have a lack of bandwidth, ie you have more work than you can 	reasonably do. In this case you’re likely looking for a smart person who 	can help you get more done.

##	Write your project brief

Be clear about the specific workstreams, expectations and deliverables 	that you need for this project to be a success. The time you spend getting 	this right will be repaid later via better staffing and fewer problems.

##	Identify the workstreams

Most projects have multiple subcomponents. You should be able to break down these components into 1-3 main tasks. These are your titles. You then fill in 3-5 specific items under each of these. You can see an example here. The goal is to provide enough information to candidates so that they have a sense of the type and amount of work required for this work.

##	Identify the deliverables

Next, you need to identify what you’re looking for at the end of the project. The deliverables can range from a financial model to a market research report depending on your needs.

Once you have completed this section you should be able to clearly communicate what you’re looking for. This means you’re ready to looks for your candidate.

#	Define the candidate criteria

The level of detail here depends on which need you’ve identified. If you’re looking for extra bandwidth, then you might have more leeway in your requirements. You are likely looking for a generalist with a core skillset such as market researching skills, excel or powerpoint skills.

If you have a specific need, then your requirements write themselves. Should you find yourself struggling to identify the skills, then you can reverse engineer it. Start with your own (and/or your team’s) skill or knowledge gaps and solve for those gaps.

##	Seniority

The experience-level depends on the type of work you need. If you want someone to do data analysis, then you likely want someone more junior. This is someone pre-MBA or a current student. If you’re looking for more nuanced input, then more experience might be preferable. Often, we see clients looking for someone with a blend of these two. That often means a person with 3-5 years experience post-MBA. This is often someone who holds the title Manager at a consulting firm or large company. Feel free to reference our seniority guide here.

##	Functional experience

You should have a clear idea of what you’re looking for here. If you’re doing a due diligence project, then you’ll want someone who has worked in Investment Banking/Corporate Development (link to Ag project). If you’re researching a specific region/industry then having someone with relevant experience is important (link to China project).

##	Industry Experience

It is important to consider how direct and granular you need the experience to be. Do you prefer someone who worked in an industry as an advisor (such as a banker or consultant) or directly in the industry? Beware of the unicorn demands!

## Geographic focus

The degree of localization will depend on where you are in the process. For example, let’s say you’re looking for an assessment of the Indian food-delivery market. At an early stage, you might just want someone who knows the Indian market broadly. At a later stage, a deeper understanding of the regional differences becomes more important.

## Language abilities

Language is important if you require someone to interact with local participants or do research where most of the work is done in a native language. Unless you think there’s a difference between English and American, this is probably the easiest of the choices!

The goal in selecting your candidate is to find the best person who can help you achieve your goals. It is like dating- there’s rarely a perfect candidate, but there are many great matches. The goal is to find someone who complements your skills well and who you can work with. If you focus on that, then you will be successful.

#	Find candidates

The most efficient way to staff a project is to go to a marketplace that specializes in the functional area you’re looking to staff.

##	Strategic business or legal advice

I’d recommend Hillgate or RocketLawyer.

##	Development

I’d recommend Gun.io or Pickcrew.com.

##	Data Science

I’d recommend Kaggle or Experfy.

##	Tactical/Admin

Odesk/Elance or Peopleperhour.com.

##	Design

I’d recommend Design Crowd or 99designs.

#	Prepare the “other stuff”

Perhaps contrary to the name, this section is important. Unfortunately, these details are often over-looked. That’s because it can be awkward to discuss some of the details, especially the budget. Transparency is the best approach here. When both parties share their position it leads to faster, more trusted negotiations. Examples of negotiation strategies can be found here.

##	Budget

Your project budget should be combination of what you can spend and the fair-market value of the person you’re contracting. If you find budget to be a significant impediment, then focus on changing the scope of the project to fit within both party’s needs.

##	Timing

When do you need the work completed? You will want to set a deadline for the project that is before the actual due date. At the beginning of your search process this can be a placeholder that is refined once you’ve engaged in the final scope/budget negotiations.

##	Location of work (remote vs on-site)

Most projects can be completed remotely, especially if you’re looking at a new geography or industry. This is even truer in the age of Skype and Dropbox. Sometimes, you need the person on-site. Often, you can work out a combination of both. In fact, there is usually very little reason to have someone on-site 100% of the time. Remote or hybrid working can save significant budget and time for everyone involved.

##	Payment terms

Ideally, you should organize a payment schedule that benefits both parties. This usually involves the client paying a percentage (25-50%) up front and the remainder upon successful completion of the project. If the project is short-term (say less than two weeks), then you might adjust the terms so that the candidate is compensated at the end of the project.

#	Organize the paperwork

Congratulations, you’re almost there! Getting here means you’ve found the right person and agreed to the terms of working together. However, the paperwork stage is often where things grind to a halt. You might not have a template or previous example to work with. You might need to work with your internal stakeholders (Procurement, Legal, HR). This can really hold up the process, especially if you’re trying to contract with an individual.

As soon as you know you will be looking to bring in an external resource, you should start working to ensure that you have these documents and processes in place. This is where the benefit of a third-party marketplace (like Hillgate) is clear. You can engage the company as a vendor and, once completed, you can reengage consultants through the same channel without the hassle of additional paperwork.

##	Terms and conditions (NDAs,etc)

This is usually the core document(s) that covers confidentiality, expectations and explains how various situations are dealt with. It will explain the broader relationship between two parties. You will want to make sure you have something in place prior to starting your project.

##	Sign the project contract

This should be specific to the project work. It should cover all the details we’ve covered in sections 1-4 and should be signed by both parties.

##	Pay the contract

This process should be simple, but too often it isn’t. Internal bureaucracy, delayed response rates and/or cash flows can impact the timing of payment. Of course, you should try to pay according to the terms. However, when there is a problem you should communicate with your counter-party and inform them of what you’re doing (and, perhaps, what they can do) to expedite the situation.

Managing the paperwork can be the most challenging part of the process. It can impact on the timing of your project and the happiness of your candidate. This is why it is so important to ensure that you have a plan to manage this component of the process.
